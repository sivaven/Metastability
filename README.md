# Metastability / Itinerancy / Quasi attractors / State transitions
 Dynamical complexity in ensembles of bursting oscillators
 
 This package contains a .cpp to simulate networks of spiking/bursting Izhikevich neurons and .m scripts for post-simulation analysis.
 
 Networks are simulated on CARLsim, a GPU-accelerated simulator.

 “A user-friendly and highly optimized library for the creation of neurobiologically detailed spiking neural networks,” in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (Killarney, IE).
 
 Matlab scripts are provided for the following:
  - measure synchrony/stability among pairs of oscillators
  - plot distributions of stability 
  - construct state transition matrix at the level of individual pairs
  - measure dynamical complexity
